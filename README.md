ShareJSXML
=======

This is a little server & client library to allow concurrent editing. The server runs on NodeJS and the client works in NodeJS or a web browser.

ShareJSXML currently supports operational transform on plain-text, arbitrary JSON data (inherited from its parent [ShareJS](https://github.com/josephg/ShareJS/tree/0.6)), and XML data.
